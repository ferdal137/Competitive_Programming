# Competitive_Programming

### This repository contains my solutions and notes on competitive programming problems, specifically those that are frequently seen in the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC).

## Introduction
Competitive programming is a sport that involves solving algorithmic problems under time pressure. The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is one of the most well-known competitions in this field, where teams from universities around the world compete to solve a set of challenging problems.

### The repository is organized into the following distinct sections:

### Getting Started
In this section, we'll cover the basics of competitive programming and what you need to know before you start. This will include topics such as data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques.

### C++ Fundamentals
Here, we'll dive into the basics of C++ programming language, including syntax, variables, data types, and control structures.

### Advanced C++ Topics
Once you have a good understanding of the fundamentals, we'll cover some advanced C++ topics that are commonly used in competitive programming, such as templates, STL, and advanced data structures.

### ICPC Strategies
In this section, we'll explore different strategies that are commonly used in the ICPC, including greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms.

### Practice Problems
To become proficient in competitive programming, you need to practice solving problems. We'll provide a curated list of practice problems that are specifically tailored towards the ICPC.

### Contest Preparation
Finally, we'll cover some tips and tricks to help you prepare for the ICPC, including time management, contest strategy, and mindset.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, this repository has something for everyone who wants to excel in the ICPC using C++. So dive in and start sharpening your competitive programming skills!
